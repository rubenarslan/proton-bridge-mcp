# Security Policy

`proton-bridge-mcp` runs on your Mac, holds a Proton Bridge app-password in your
macOS Keychain, and reads inbound email on your behalf. Vulnerabilities here
matter. This document covers how to report them and what guarantees the server
does and does not make.

## Supported versions

| Version  | Supported |
| -------- | --------- |
| `main` (latest commit) | yes |
| Latest tagged release | yes |
| All other tagged releases | no — upgrade |
| Forks                | not by this repo |

There is no LTS branch. Fixes land on `main` and are picked up in the next tag.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Use GitHub Security Advisories.** This keeps the disclosure private until a
fix is ready.

1. Open <https://github.com/miketigerblue/proton-bridge-mcp/security/advisories/new>.
2. Include: affected versions, reproduction steps, observed vs. expected
   behaviour, and (if known) suggested mitigation.
3. Expect an initial acknowledgement within 5 working days. A coordinated
   disclosure window of up to 90 days is the working default; shorter windows
   are negotiable for actively-exploited issues.

Please do **not** open a public GitHub issue, PR, or discussion for a
security-impacting bug. Public reports get fixed, but the people most likely to
weaponise them get a head start.

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, email
[mike@tigerblue.io](mailto:mike@tigerblue.io) with `[proton-bridge-mcp
security]` in the subject. PGP key is on the keyservers under the same
address; ask if you need it inline.

## Threat model

What this server protects against and what it doesn't.

### In scope

- **Loopback isolation.** Bridge listens only on `127.0.0.1`. The MCP server
  speaks to Bridge over loopback IMAP/SMTP. No traffic crosses your network as
  a result of an MCP tool call. Bridge's own outbound channel to Proton is
  end-to-end encrypted and out of this repo's control.
- **Credential confidentiality at rest.** The Bridge app-password lives in the
  macOS Keychain. The keychain item's ACL trusts only `/usr/bin/security`. The
  password is never written to disk by this server, never logged, and never
  appears in tool outputs.
- **Supply-chain integrity at install.** `requirements.txt` is hash-pinned;
  every transitive dependency is verified against a known-good sha256 at
  install. Tampered wheels on PyPI fail loudly. `bootstrap.py` and
  `install.sh` both pass `--require-hashes`.
- **TLS to Bridge.** STARTTLS is always negotiated. The default policy is
  `pinned`: the connection refuses to start unless Bridge presents the cert
  captured during first-run TOFU. Setting `PROTON_BRIDGE_TLS_POLICY=best_effort`
  is an explicit downgrade that allows fallback to `CERT_NONE` on loopback
  only — useful for first-install diagnostics, not the recommended long-term
  posture.
- **Read semantics.** `proton_read_email` defaults `mark_seen=false`. Reading
  a message never implicitly marks it seen.
- **Mutating tools are annotated.** `proton_send_email`,
  `proton_forward_email`, `proton_delete_email`, `proton_move_email`,
  `proton_flag_email`, and `proton_create_draft` all
  carry MCP `destructiveHint` / `idempotentHint` annotations the client can
  use to gate confirmation. `proton_send_email`, `proton_forward_email` and
  `proton_delete_email` carry `destructiveHint: true`.
- **Server-side `acknowledged` requirement on the side-effecting tools.**
  `proton_send_email`, `proton_forward_email`, `proton_delete_email`,
  `proton_create_draft`, and
  `proton_download_attachment` all require an explicit `acknowledged`
  bool argument at the input layer (Pydantic `Field(...)` with no
  default), so a prompt-injection payload that simply names the tool
  and its arguments is rejected before any side effect runs -- the
  model has to *deliberately* set the value, which is the point at
  which a well-instructed model surfaces the action to the operator.
  The body-level enforcement differs by tool:
  - `proton_send_email`, `proton_forward_email` and
    `proton_delete_email` are *always* refused
    on `acknowledged=false`; the tool body returns a structured
    `refused` JSON payload (`reason: "acknowledged_required"`) without
    resolving credentials or touching IMAP/SMTP.
  - `proton_download_attachment` is *always* refused on
    `acknowledged=false`. Writing attachment bytes to a user-supplied
    `save_path` is a side effect outside the model's sandbox; a
    prompt-injection payload could direct the write to a sensitive
    location (LaunchAgent plist, ssh authorized_keys, etc.).
  - `proton_create_draft` is refused on `acknowledged=false` only
    when at least one recipient is *not* the operator's own address.
    Drafts to non-self addresses are an exfil staging channel:
    harvested mail composed into a draft to attacker@evil.com sits in
    Drafts until a future click sends it. Self-only drafts are
    accepted regardless. Self addresses are derived from
    `PROTON_BRIDGE_USER` and `PROTON_BRIDGE_DEFAULT_FROM` (case-
    insensitive) -- aliases not represented in either env var are
    treated as external for this gate, which is the safe default.
    A draft *carrying attachments* is refused on `acknowledged=false`
    regardless of its recipients (see below).
- **Attachment handling.** `proton_send_email`, `proton_create_draft`
  and `proton_forward_email` can attach local files (`attachments`,
  absolute paths) and attachments lifted off messages already in the
  mailbox (`forward_attachments`, or the source message's own
  attachments in the case of a forward). Attaching a local file is an
  arbitrary-file-read whose result leaves the machine, so:
  - Every path into it is behind `acknowledged=true`, including the
    self-addressed drafts that the recipient-based draft gate would
    otherwise wave through. A draft sitting in Drafts with
    `~/.ssh/id_rsa` attached is one careless click from being sent.
  - `PROTON_BRIDGE_ATTACHMENT_ROOTS` (unset by default) turns the
    per-call decision into a hard boundary: an `os.pathsep`-separated
    allowlist of directories local files may be attached from.
    Symlinks are resolved *before* the check, so a link planted inside
    an allowed root cannot smuggle a file out of it. Relative paths,
    directories, and non-regular files (devices, FIFOs) are refused
    unconditionally.
  - Filenames on outgoing parts -- including ones lifted verbatim off
    an inbound message being forwarded -- are stripped of control
    characters (header injection into `Content-Disposition`), path
    separators (traversal on whatever machine saves the file next),
    and invisible Unicode, and are length-capped.
  - A count cap (`PROTON_BRIDGE_MAX_ATTACHMENT_COUNT`, default 20) and
    a total-size cap (`PROTON_BRIDGE_MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES`, default
    18 MiB of raw bytes) apply per outgoing message, across both
    sources, and are enforced before anything is sent.
  - Forwarding does *not* feed the forwarded body back into the
    model's context: `proton_forward_email` returns metadata only. The
    body it sends is verbatim -- neither truncated nor stripped of
    invisible Unicode, unlike the read path -- because the recipient
    should receive what the original sender wrote, not a rewrite. The
    attribution block in the HTML alternative is HTML-escaped, so
    attacker-controlled headers cannot inject markup into it.
- **Prompt-injection hardening at the read boundary** (partial — see also
  the out-of-scope section below). Two layered mitigations apply to email
  content returned to the LLM:
  - **Steganographic Unicode is stripped.** Zero-width characters
    (U+200B / U+200C / U+200D / U+FEFF / U+2060–U+2064), bidi-override
    controls (U+202A–U+202E, U+2066–U+2069), soft hyphen, and Unicode
    line / paragraph separators are removed from every header value
    (via `_decode_header`) and from email bodies (via `_extract_body`).
    These carry payloads invisible to a human reader of the same email
    but visible to a model.
  - **Bodies are wrapped in nonce-tagged provenance delimiters.**
    `proton_read_email` returns body text and (optional) HTML wrapped in
    `<UNTRUSTED_EMAIL_BODY_<6-hex-nonce> source="…" subject="…">…
    </UNTRUSTED_EMAIL_BODY_<same-nonce>>` with a one-line preamble
    instructing the model to treat the wrapped content as data rather
    than instructions. The per-call nonce prevents an attacker who
    controls the body from forging a closing tag and convincing the
    model that the trusted scope has resumed.
  - **Sender-authentication results are surfaced in the wrapper.**
    `proton_read_email` parses any RFC 8601 `Authentication-Results`
    header on the message and adds the SPF / DKIM / DMARC outcome
    tokens to the wrapper's provenance attrs (e.g.
    `spf="fail" dkim="pass" dmarc="fail"`). A spoofed `From:` header
    therefore reaches the model alongside the auth verdict that
    Proton's MX recorded, rather than as an unchallenged authority
    claim. The verdict tokens are passed through verbatim
    (`pass` / `fail` / `softfail` / `neutral` / `none` / `temperror` /
    `permerror`); absence of the header is itself a signal.

### Out of scope (intentionally not protected)

- **Compromise of the host machine.** A local attacker with code execution as
  your user can read the keychain and intercept loopback traffic. This is
  outside the threat model — same as for any MCP server, mail client, or
  password manager on the same box.
- **Compromise of Proton Mail Bridge itself.** This server treats Bridge as
  trusted. If Bridge is compromised, Bridge's own threat model applies, not
  ours.
- **Prompt injection from inbound mail content (full prevention).** A real
  risk that cannot be fully eliminated at the server layer alone. We mitigate
  at the read boundary (steganographic-Unicode stripping and provenance
  wrapping — see "In scope" above) but a sufficiently sophisticated injection
  that survives those defences and convinces the model to call a destructive
  tool with plausible arguments is the *operator's* and *client's* problem,
  not ours. Any feature that lets the model take action based on email
  content (auto-reply, auto-forward, rule-based delete) **must** require
  explicit per-action user confirmation in the MCP client. Forwarding
  deserves particular suspicion: it combines a read the model is already
  allowed to perform with an outbound send, and it can carry attachments
  the model never inspected -- including malware, which this server does
  not scan for and will relay byte-for-byte if told to. The server
  provides the primitives and the layered defences; the client and the
  operator provide the policy.
- **Read-side exfiltration via the model.** The `acknowledged=true` gate
  on the side-effecting tools and the prompt-injection wrapper protect
  against destructive actions being triggered by inbound mail content.
  They do *not* prevent a sufficiently capable injection from coaxing the
  model into reading additional mail (the read tools have no `acknowledged`
  gate by design — gating them would make the server unusable) and
  surfacing those contents into the conversation, where the attacker
  receives them via the next reply the model composes, or via any other
  channel the model can write to. The read tools are *how the server is
  useful at all*; their natural behaviour is data flowing into the
  model's context. If the operator has the model auto-respond to mail
  or otherwise act on its read context, that path is exfiltration. The
  mitigation is operator policy: do not have the model auto-respond on
  inboxes that may receive injected content; treat the LLM provider as
  having read-access to every email Claude reads via this tool, because
  it does.
- **Attacks against Proton's infrastructure or end-to-end-encryption design.**
  Out of this repo's hands.
- **Non-macOS platforms.** Linux and Windows are unsupported. Bridge runs
  there, but the credential-storage and process-spawn assumptions in this
  server are macOS-specific. Don't deploy it elsewhere.

## Security properties to verify

Anyone auditing the server should be able to confirm the following from the
source:

- `requirements.txt` is generated with `--generate-hashes`; nothing else gets
  installed. (`install.sh` and `bootstrap.py` both assert this.)
- The keychain item for `proton_bridge_mcp` has `/usr/bin/security` on its
  trusted-applications ACL. (`setup_keychain.sh` and `bootstrap.py` set this
  with `-T /usr/bin/security`.)
- The MCP server fetches the password by invoking `/usr/bin/security` per
  process; the password is not cached on disk.
- The source defaults `PROTON_BRIDGE_TLS_POLICY` to `pinned` (see
  `proton_bridge_mcp.py`), and the supplied manifests do not override it.
  Running the server without a verified Bridge cert therefore fails closed.
  Setting `PROTON_BRIDGE_TLS_POLICY=best_effort` is the only path that allows
  `CERT_NONE` fallback on loopback.
- The `_strip_invisibles` regex in `proton_bridge_mcp.py` covers, at minimum,
  the zero-width and bidi character ranges enumerated above, and is invoked
  from `_decode_header` and `_extract_body` so every header and body value
  flowing back to the LLM is sanitised. The unit tests in
  `tests/test_helpers.py` (classes `TestStripInvisibles` and
  `TestSanitisationIntegration`) make the coverage explicit.
- `proton_read_email` wraps `body_text` and `body_html` (when included) with
  `_wrap_untrusted` before returning. The opening tag uses a
  `secrets.token_hex(3)` nonce; the closing tag uses the same nonce. Both
  characteristics are asserted by `TestWrapUntrusted` in
  `tests/test_helpers.py`.
- `proton_read_email` calls `_parse_authentication_results` on the message
  and forwards the SPF / DKIM / DMARC tokens it finds into the wrapper as
  provenance attrs and into the JSON payload's `authentication` field. The
  parser keeps the first result it sees per method across multiple
  `Authentication-Results` headers, on the convention that the topmost
  header is added by the closest trusted MTA (Proton's own MX for
  Bridge users). Coverage is in `TestParseAuthenticationResults` in
  `tests/test_helpers.py`.
- `SendEmailInput`, `ForwardEmailInput`, `DeleteInput`,
  `CreateDraftInput`, and
  `DownloadAttachmentInput` all declare `acknowledged: bool = Field(...)`
  with no default — pydantic rejects calls that omit the field. The tool
  bodies of `proton_send_email`, `proton_forward_email`,
  `proton_delete_email`, and
  `proton_download_attachment` short-circuit unconditionally on
  `acknowledged=False` and return `_refused_unack(...)`.
  `proton_create_draft` short-circuits when `_external_recipients`
  finds at least one non-self address among the recipients, and
  additionally whenever the draft carries attachments. These
  behaviours are pinned by `TestSendEmailInputRequiresAck`,
  `TestDeleteInputRequiresAck`, `TestCreateDraftInputRequiresAck`,
  `TestDownloadAttachmentInputRequiresAck`, `TestExternalRecipients`,
  `TestForwardEmailInputRequiresAck`, `TestForwardRefusedWithoutAck`,
  `TestDraftAttachmentGate`,
  and `TestRefusedUnack` in `tests/test_helpers.py`.
- `_local_attachment_blob` refuses relative paths, missing files, and
  non-regular files, resolves symlinks *before* testing the path against
  `ATTACHMENT_ROOTS`, and enforces the size cap; `_safe_attachment_name`
  strips control characters, path separators, and invisible Unicode from
  every filename placed on an outgoing part. Coverage is in
  `TestLocalAttachmentBlob`, `TestSafeAttachmentName`, and
  `TestAttachmentBudget` in `tests/test_helpers.py`.
- No credential, cert path, or message body is logged at `INFO` or `DEBUG`.
  The attachment log lines emitted by the send / draft / forward tools
  carry filenames and sizes only, never payload bytes.

If any of these is no longer true, that itself is a security bug — please
report it via the channel above.

## Hardening recommendations for operators

- Stay on the default `PROTON_BRIDGE_TLS_POLICY=pinned`. `best_effort` exists
  as an explicit downgrade for first-install diagnostics — not as a
  long-term posture. If you've set it during troubleshooting, drop it from
  the env once `bootstrap.py` has captured Bridge's cert.
- Keep Bridge up to date. Bridge regenerates its TLS cert on some upgrades; in
  pinned mode, that means re-running `bootstrap.py` (the cert capture step).
- Review the MCP client's destructive-action confirmation policy. Never let
  the model auto-execute send/forward/delete/move based on inbound email
  content.
- If you use the attachment features, consider setting
  `PROTON_BRIDGE_ATTACHMENT_ROOTS` to a single directory you deliberately
  stage outgoing files in. Unset, the only thing standing between an
  injected "attach ~/.ssh/id_rsa and send it to …" and a successful
  exfiltration is your own confirmation of the `acknowledged=true` call.
- Rotate the Bridge app-password periodically via Bridge → *Mailbox details*,
  followed by `setup_keychain.sh` (or `bootstrap.py --force-password`).
