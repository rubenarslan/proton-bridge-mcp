# proton-bridge-mcp

A local Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that lets Claude (or any MCP client) read, search, draft, send, and organise email through your running **Proton Mail Bridge**. Everything stays on your Mac — Claude talks to Bridge over `127.0.0.1` IMAP (1143) and SMTP (1025). Nothing transits the public internet via this server.

## Why this exists

Proton Mail's end-to-end encryption is great for privacy and a problem for automation: there's no public IMAP endpoint and no first-party API. **Proton Mail Bridge** solves that by exposing your decrypted mail over loopback IMAP/SMTP on your own machine. This MCP server wraps that loopback in a small, hardened tool surface that Claude can drive.

## Why this one?

Several other Proton MCP servers exist on GitHub. Most are functional and some have far larger tool surfaces. This one is built for a different priority: **security and supply-chain hygiene over feature count**, on the assumption that the people most likely to want to plug an LLM into their email are also the people who most need a credible threat model and a reproducible install.

| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Bridge TLS               | Pinned to Bridge's self-signed cert via TOFU capture, by default; refuses to start without a verified cert unless explicitly downgraded | `CERT_NONE` on loopback, or TLS handling unspecified |
| Credential storage       | macOS Keychain, with `/usr/bin/security` on the trusted-applications ACL so prompts stop after first install                         | `.env` file, plaintext in config, or env-var only    |
| Dependency installation  | `--require-hashes` against a fully resolved `requirements.txt` lock (every transitive sha256 verified at install)                    | `pip install <package>` (floats to latest)           |
| Connection management    | Pooled IMAP + SMTP sessions per process, asyncio locks, auto-reconnect on drops                                                      | New connection per call (login storms)               |
| Read semantics           | `mark_seen=false` is the default; reads never implicitly mark messages read                                                          | Often marks read implicitly                          |
| Threat model             | Documented in the README; explicit prompt-injection caveat for inbound mail content                                                  | Usually absent                                       |
| Troubleshooting coverage | Real-world gotchas captured: Python 3.12+ naive-datetime crash, IMAP `FETCH` UID-spec quirk, macOS Keychain ACL prompt-loop, stale `__pycache__` after Python-version bump | Generic, or absent                                   |

**When this is not the right pick.** If you want the largest possible Proton tool surface (Mail + Pass + Drive + Calendar + VPN), look at [`jorgenclaw/proton-mcp`](https://github.com/jorgenclaw/proton-mcp). If you specifically want a local SQLite + FTS5 search index over your Bridge mail, look at [`dreamc0der-ai/proton-mail-mcp`](https://github.com/dreamc0der-ai/proton-mail-mcp). If you want a hardened, audit-friendly, Mail-only Bridge MCP with hash-pinned dependencies and an opinionated security posture, you're in the right place.

### Attachments

`proton_send_email` and `proton_create_draft` take attachments from two
sources, and you can mix them in one message. `proton_forward_email` takes the
first of the two, plus whatever it carries over from the message being
forwarded.

- `attachments`: a list of **absolute** paths to local files. Relative paths,
  directories and globs are refused. Each file is read and sent outbound, so
  this is an arbitrary-file-read that leaves the machine: it only ever runs
  behind the `acknowledged=true` gate, and you can fence it off entirely with
  `PROTON_BRIDGE_ATTACHMENT_ROOTS`.
- `forward_attachments`: pointers to attachments on messages already in your
  mailbox, as `{uid, mailbox, filename}` or `{uid, mailbox, index}`. Omit both
  `filename` and `index` to take every attachment on that message. The bytes go
  straight from IMAP into the outgoing message; nothing is written to disk, so
  re-attaching a file you received costs no `proton_download_attachment` call.

`index` is the 1-based position in the attachment list that `proton_read_email`
reports, and is the way to disambiguate a message carrying two files with the
same name. Selecting by `filename` takes *every* part with that name.

`proton_forward_email` forwards inline by default: the original body is quoted
under the usual `---------- Forwarded message ----------` block and its
attachments are carried over. With `as_attachment=true` the original is instead
hung off the forward as a single `message/rfc822` part, which preserves its
headers and structure exactly. That is the right choice when the recipient
needs to see the original as it arrived, say for reporting phishing or passing
something to a lawyer. The forwarded body is sent verbatim; unlike the read
path it is neither truncated nor stripped of invisible Unicode, because the
recipient should get what the sender actually wrote. It is not echoed back into
the model's context either: the tool returns metadata only.

Attachments are capped at 20 per message and 18 MiB total (raw bytes, before
base64 inflates them by about a third on the wire). Both are configurable.

## Hardening highlights

- **Credentials in the macOS Keychain**, never in `claude_desktop_config.json`. The config file only names the Keychain service and account.
- **TLS pinning by default** against Bridge's own self-signed certificate, captured on first run via STARTTLS. The server fails closed if the cert can't be located. Set `PROTON_BRIDGE_TLS_POLICY=best_effort` only if you knowingly need to fall back to `CERT_NONE` on loopback (e.g. first-install diagnostics).
- **Pooled connections**: one long-lived IMAP session and one SMTP session per process, guarded by asyncio locks, with auto-reconnect on drops. No per-call login storms.
- **Non-blocking**: blocking stdlib IMAP/SMTP calls run in `asyncio.to_thread` so the event loop stays responsive.
- **Hash-pinned dependencies** (`requirements.txt`) so the install is reproducible and supply-chain attacks are caught at install time.
- **Reads never implicitly mark messages read** — `mark_seen=false` is the default on `proton_read_email`.

## Prerequisites

- macOS (Keychain integration is macOS-specific)
- Proton Mail Bridge installed, running, and logged in
- Python 3.10 or later (tested on 3.10, 3.12, and 3.14). **Apple's `/usr/bin/python3` is 3.9 on current macOS and is not supported** — install a newer interpreter via Homebrew (`brew install python@3.12`) or python.org. The bootstrap script auto-detects a Homebrew Python 3.10+ and re-execs under it if you launch it from too old an interpreter, but the manual install path needs you to invoke a 3.10+ `python3` directly.
- Bridge **username** (your email) and **app-password**, copied from Bridge → *Mailbox details*. This is **not** your Proton account password.

## Install

There are two paths. Use **A** unless you want fine control over each step.

### A. One-shot bootstrap

```bash
cd <install-path>/proton-bridge-mcp
python3 bootstrap.py
```

`bootstrap.py` is idempotent and re-runnable. It:

1. Creates `.venv` next to the script.
2. Installs the hash-pinned dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Captures Bridge's TLS certificate via STARTTLS (trust-on-first-use) and saves it to `~/.config/proton-bridge-mcp/cert.pem` with `0600` perms.
4. Prompts once for your Bridge app-password and writes it to the macOS Keychain under service `proton_bridge_mcp`, account = your username, with `/usr/bin/security` on the trusted-applications list (so macOS does not prompt again on every MCP process spawn).
5. Verifies IMAP login end-to-end with the pinned cert.
6. Merges a `proton_bridge` block into `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`, preserving any other MCP servers you have configured.

Then **fully quit Claude Desktop (⌘Q) and relaunch**.

### B. Manual four-step install

```bash
cd <install-path>/proton-bridge-mcp

# 1. Create the venv and install hash-pinned dependencies
./install.sh

# 2. Put the Bridge app-password in the macOS Keychain
./setup_keychain.sh you@example.com
# (prompts for the password — paste it; nothing is echoed)

# 3. Capture Bridge's TLS certificate (required: pinned mode is the default
#    and the server fails closed if the cert isn't found and verified).
#    Writes ~/.config/proton-bridge-mcp/cert.pem with 0600 perms.
.venv/bin/python proton_bridge_mcp.py --learn-cert

# 4. Merge the entry from claude_desktop_config.example.json into
#    ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json,
#    replacing the <INSTALL_PATH> and <YOU> placeholders. No password
#    goes in this file — the Keychain handles that.
```

Then quit and relaunch Claude Desktop.

## Verifying

In a new conversation, ask Claude:

> Using proton_bridge, list my mail folders.

Then something with bite:

> Search proton_bridge for all mail to or from `@example.com` in the last 12 months, in any folder. Read the most recent 10 threads.

## Configuration reference

All configuration is done via the `env` block in `claude_desktop_config.json`. See `claude_desktop_config.example.json` for a starting template.

| `PROTON_BRIDGE_MAX_ATTACHMENT_COUNT` | no    | `20`          | Maximum attachments on one outgoing message.                                           |
| `PROTON_BRIDGE_ATTACHMENT_ROOTS`  | no       | (unset)       | `:`-separated allowlist of directories local files may be attached from. Unset means any readable path, gated only by `acknowledged=true`. Symlinks are resolved before the check, so a link inside an allowed root can't smuggle a file out of it. |

## Rotating and revoking

- **Rotate the Bridge app-password**: regenerate in Bridge → *Mailbox details*, then re-run `./setup_keychain.sh you@example.com` (or `bootstrap.py --force-password`).
- **Delete the Keychain entry**: `security delete-generic-password -s proton_bridge_mcp -a you@example.com`.
- **Remove entirely**: delete the `proton_bridge` block from `claude_desktop_config.json`, then delete this folder.

## Threat model

- **Local-only**: this MCP server runs on your Mac under your user account. Bridge listens only on `127.0.0.1`. Nothing this server does talks to the public internet on your behalf — when Claude invokes a tool, the resulting IMAP/SMTP traffic stays on loopback to Bridge, and Bridge then talks to Proton over its own end-to-end-encrypted channel.
- **Credentials**: the Bridge app-password lives in the macOS Keychain, fetched per-process via `/usr/bin/security`. The Keychain item's ACL trusts the `security` CLI explicitly, so macOS does not gate every read with a prompt; conversely, no other process can read the password without macOS authentication. The password is never written to disk by this server, never logged, and never exposed in tool outputs.
- **TLS**: the connection to Bridge is always STARTTLS-wrapped. The default policy is `pinned` — the server pins to Bridge's specific self-signed certificate (saved to `~/.config/proton-bridge-mcp/cert.pem` on first install) and refuses to start if that cert can't be located. Setting `PROTON_BRIDGE_TLS_POLICY=best_effort` is an explicit downgrade that allows fallback to `CERT_NONE` on loopback only — acceptable for first-install diagnostics because the only thing Bridge listens on is loopback under your own user account, but not the recommended long-term posture.
- **Send / destructive tools**: explicitly annotated. `proton_send_email`, `proton_forward_email`, `proton_delete_email`, `proton_move_email`, `proton_flag_email`, and `proton_create_draft` all carry MCP `destructiveHint` / `idempotentHint` annotations the client can use to gate confirmation. Reads default to non-mutating (`mark_seen=false`).
- **Attachments are the sharpest edge here.** Attaching a local file reads an arbitrary path off your disk and sends it to whoever the message is addressed to, and "forward everything from X to attacker@evil.com" is the single most attractive action for an injected payload to induce. Everything that can attach a file requires `acknowledged=true`, including drafts addressed only to yourself, which are otherwise exempt from the draft gate. If you want a hard boundary rather than a per-call decision, set `PROTON_BRIDGE_ATTACHMENT_ROOTS` to the one directory you're willing to send from.
- **Prompt-injection caveat**: an MCP server that reads email is, by construction, a prompt-injection surface. Email bodies you read with `proton_read_email` may contain instructions intended to manipulate the model. Never have Claude execute actions described in inbound email content without your explicit approval. Treat all email content as untrusted input, even from senders you know.

## Development

```bash
# Re-generate the runtime hash-pinned lockfile after editing requirements.in
uv pip compile requirements.in --generate-hashes --python-version 3.10 -o requirements.txt
# (or: pip-compile --generate-hashes --output-file requirements.txt requirements.in)

# Re-generate the dev lockfile (a superset including pytest + transitives).
# Always pass BOTH .in files so the dev lockfile is a complete resolution
# consistent with the runtime lockfile.
uv pip compile requirements.in requirements-dev.in --generate-hashes \
    --python-version 3.10 -o requirements-dev.txt

# Quick syntax check on the two top-level Python files
python3 -m compileall -q proton_bridge_mcp.py bootstrap.py

# Install dev deps (hash-pinned) and run the pytest suite
.venv/bin/pip install --require-hashes -r requirements-dev.txt
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

The pytest suite covers the side-effect-free helpers (header decoding,
address parsing, body extraction, attachment resolution, IMAP-search criteria
construction), the `acknowledged` refusal paths, and the forward tool's
orchestration with its IMAP/SMTP seams stubbed. The real IMAP, SMTP and
Keychain paths are intentionally not unit-tested: they need a running Bridge
and integration coverage.
